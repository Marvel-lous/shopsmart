- Adjusted the gender column i.e. M - Male, F - Female and I applied proper case.
- Adjusted the currency column where USD was changed to "$".
- The "Is Active" column was changed to No or Yes.
- I checked for blanks, rows with two or more blank cells were completely removed from my dataset (Listwise deletion).
- Blanks in the "Age column" were filled at random.
- Blanks in the "Years Of Experience column" were filled at random.
- Blanks in the "Hourly Rate(Usd) column" were filled at random using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) imputation.
